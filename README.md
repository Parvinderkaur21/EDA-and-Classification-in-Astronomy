To perform Exploratory Data Analysis on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 17 (DR17). This catalogue contains photometric data for all objects viewed through a telescope and spectroscopic data for a small part of these. Train ML classification models on the labelled Photometric data which is spectroscopically classified with labels. The EDA helps to choose the right models for the dataset. All the information gained from conducting EDA helps to choose a data model. 

We will apply the trained models which have the highest accuracy when trained on the training set , on new unclassified data which is accessible from the SDSS server.
